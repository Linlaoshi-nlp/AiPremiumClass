Actions and observations: Instead of focusing on human-privileged actions and observations, agents in the era of experience will act autonomously in the real world. Examples of this are agentic systems that can interact with external applications and resources through tools such as computer use and Model Context Protocol (MCP). [...] “By building upon the foundations of RL and adapting its core principles to the challenges of this new era, we can unlock the full potential of autonomous learning and pave the way to truly superhuman intelligence,” Sutton and Silver write.\\n\\nDeepMind declined to provide additional comments for the story.\\n\\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily [...] The era of experience means that developers will have to build their applications not only for humans but also with AI agents in mind. Machine-friendly actions require building secure and accessible APIs that can easily be accessed directly or through interfaces such as MCP. It also means creating agents that can be made discoverable through protocols such as Google’s Agent2Agent. You will also need to design your APIs and agentic interfaces to provide access to both actions and observations.', 'score': 0.680136}, {'title': 'AI\\'s \"Era of Experience\" - by Ben Dickson - TechTalks', 'url': 'https://bdtechtalks.substack.com/p/ais-era-of-experience', 'content': 'In a new paper (PDF), David Silver and Richard Sutton, two renowned AI scientists, argue that the pace of progress driven solely by supervised learning from human data is slowing and that we need a new approach to create better systems, which they call the “Era of Experience.” Instead of relying on human data, AI systems will gather data from their experience in the world and use it to improve themselves. [...] For example, if a user says they want to stay fit, an AI health assistant can combine that high-level goal with other reward signals, such as the user’s vital signs and health metrics, to create a composite reward function. As the user progresses and provides feedback to the agent, it can gradually adjust its reward function with the user’s changing goals, adding new metrics and data or removing those that are no longer relevant.\\n\\nPlanning and reasoning\\n---------------------- [...] “Powerful agents should have their own stream of experience that progresses, like humans, over a long timescale,” the authors write. “This will allow agents to take actions to achieve future goals, and to continuously adapt over time to new patterns of behaviour.”', 'score': 0.62879556}, {'title': 'Welcome to The Era of Experience - Medium', 'url': 'https://medium.com/@la_boukouffallah/welcome-to-the-era-of-experience-028440180a86', 'content': 'The paper highlights an example: AlphaProof, an AI that achieved a silver-medal standard in the International Mathematical Olympiad. While it started with a small set of human-created math proofs, AlphaProof used reinforcement learning (a type of experiential learning) to generate millions of new proofs by interacting with a mathematical system. This allowed it to solve problems that went beyond human knowledge, showcasing the power of learning through experience. [...] Experiential learning isn’t brand new — AI has used it before in controlled settings, like playing board games (think AlphaZero mastering chess) or optimizing data center cooling. But these were narrow tasks with clear rules and rewards. The Era of Experience is about applying this approach to the messy, open-ended real world. [...] The Era of Experience is a bold vision for AI’s future. By moving beyond human data and learning through interaction with the world, AI could achieve capabilities we can’t yet imagine. This shift builds on decades of reinforcement learning research, combining it with today’s powerful AI systems to create agents that are autonomous, adaptable, and truly intelligent.', 'score': 0.61779}, {'title': 'Pioneering the Era of Experience - Scale AI', 'url': 'https://scale.com/blog/era-of-experience', 'content': 'But measuring against human experts isn\\'t the final goal. To truly surpass them, as Silver and Sutton argue, AI must learn beyond the confines of pre-existing human knowledge, possibly even beyond human language. This new paradigm, the \"Era of Experience,\" is one where AI generates its own understanding by interacting with the world itself. [...] This paradigm shift seen in the “Era of Experience” calls for our community to consider anew our roles as guides and collaborators. For Scale, this means continuing our mission to pioneer the robust evaluation methodologies, data frameworks, and interactive environments necessary for these experiential systems to develop safely and effectively. The expertise we have developed will remain essential, but applied in new contexts: creating the most valuable environments for agents to learn from, [...] The saturation of traditional benchmarks and the insights from evals like HLE underscore that ushering in the \"Era of Experience\" requires creating the conditions for experiential learning to occur.

This data must be generated in a way that continually improves as the agent becomes stronger; any static procedure for synthetically generating data will quickly become outstripped. This can be achieved by allowing agents to learn continually from their own experience, i.e., data that is generated by the agent interacting with its environment. AI is at the cusp of a new period in which experience will become the dominant [...] Open menu Open navigation has made remarkable strides over recent years by training on massive amounts of human-generated data and fine-tuning with expert human examples and preferences. This approach is exem plified by large language models (LLMs) that have achieved a sweeping level of generality.
